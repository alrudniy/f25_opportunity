Bug 1
    what caused it?
      query = request.GET.get('q').strip() caused the error

    how you found it (breakpoints, variable watch, exception trace)
        I set a breakpoint on line 26 (query = request.GET.get('q').strip()). 
        Once I ran the debugger and visited the website, http://127.0.0.1:8000/buggy/. I received an attribute error at /buggy/ stating that I had no attribute 'strip'. 

    how you fixed it
      I replaced line 26 where the error was with query = (request.GET.get('q') or "").strip(). 

Bug 2
    what caused it?
      if field_filter is not 'All': caused the error because it is using 'is not'
    
    how you found it (breakpoints, variable watch, exception trace)
      I set up a breakpoint on the code with the error. I then visted the website, http://127.0.0.1:8000/buggy/?q=ai&field=All
      In the debugger view, the variables dropdown showed "field_filter = 'All'". So, it showed all the projects.

    how you fixed it
      I replaced the line with if field_filter != 'All', ensuring that the filter only happens when the field is different from 'All'.

Bug 3
    what caused it?
      Line 36: return query.lower() in p['title'].lower() or query.lower() in p['descriptionn'].lower() caused the error because description was not spelled right causing a KeyError.
    
    how you found it (breakpoints, variable watch, exception trace)
      I set up a breakpoint on the code with the error. When stepping inside the function, we received a KeyError error confirming that it was misspelled. 

    how you fixed it
      I replaced the line with the correct spelling. This fixed the error and allowed the search to work correctly.
